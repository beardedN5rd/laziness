After all I am anoyed of installing the usual setup I want by hand on different machines I use, so ansible is the way to go.

The Vagrantfile is only intended for testing the installation stuff without compromising the "real system".

ATM the configuration is intended to be used with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, if you want to use it with a different debian based OS, please adapt the used vagrant box, so you can test it before.
